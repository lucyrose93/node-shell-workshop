## Lesson 1 - Writing your own shell script

_Please clone this repo and go into the lesson-1 folder in your terminal. The relevant files for this lesson are there._

### Introduction

It's important to realise that, in giving you access to the file system and network,
node can be used for more than just creating web servers. In this series of lessons we are going to use some of node's features to do some shell scripting!

A shell script is a program designed to be run by the Unix shell. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

You've likely come across some typical shell commands already. Have you used `cat` or `ls` in your terminal before? Today you're going to implement your own version of these commands using javascript!

From your terminal if you want to execute a javascript program you've written you can use the following command:

```
node path_to_program.js
```

Note the path you give to the program is relative to what directory you are in.

Something you may not know is that you can actually pass arguments into your javascript program from the command line as well. For example:

```
node path_to_program.js node is awesome
```

All arguments (in this case `'node'`, `'is'`, and `'awesome'`, separated by spaces) will be passed into your program as strings and can be accessed inside it using an object called `process` that is in-built with node.

`process` has a property called `argv`. It is an array. `process.argv[0]` is always the path to node on your machine, and `process.argv[1]` is always the path to the executed javascript file.

In this case `process.argv` will be:

```javscript
process.argv // = [path_to_node, path_to_current_file, 'node', 'is', 'awesome'];

// so you can access the arguments you pass in like so:

process.argv[2] // = 'node';
process.argv[3] // = 'is';
process.argv[4] // = 'awesome';

```

This is useful as it means we can pass into our programs the names of, or paths to, files, to be manipulated within the node program.

`process` has other useful methods. One in particular is `process.stdout.write()`. It is very similar to `console.log()` in that it will take what you input it and output it to the terminal. It has subtle differences, try experimenting with both in this exercise.

In this case if we use `node path_to_file.js node is awesome` to call `path_to_file.js` and inside the program write:

```
process.stdout.write(process.argv[2] + process.argv[3] + process.argv[4]);
```

It will output `node is awesome` to the terminal.

### Exercise 1a - cat command

In Unix, `cat` is a command that takes the path to a file as its argument and will output the contents of that file to the terminal. It is used like this:

`cat path_to_file`

Try outputting the contents of `index.html` in the public folder of this repo to the terminal to see what it looks like.

Inside `cat.js` write a program that when called like this from the terminal

`node path_to_cat.js path_to_file`

will output the contents of that latter file to the terminal like `cat`.

*Hint: You will need the `process` object and the `fs` module.*

### Exercise 1b - ls command

`ls` is a command that when called will output to the terminal the names of all the files and directories in the directory it was called from.

Try using `ls` in one of the folders of this repo to see what it looks like.

Inside `ls.js` write a program that when called from the terminal will output to the terminal the names of all the files and directories in the directory you called from.

Calling `node path_to_ls.js` from the lesson-1 folder of this repo should print:

`cat.js ls.js  public`

Don't worry about being exact with the spacing, just print them on the same line with some spacing.

*Hint: you're going to need the method `process.cwd()` to access the directory your node command was called from.*

### Exercise 1c - flags

Many unix commands have what are called flags. Flags are arguments you can pass to the execution of the command that modify its behaviour. They are typically in the format of a dash followed by a lowercase letter.

For example, `ls -a` will show all directories/files, including those starting with a dot (like `.gitignore`) that will otherwise be hidden when you call the `ls` command.

Your task is to modify your existing `ls` command in `ls.js` so that it can accept an `-ex` flag. If `-ex` is passed as first argument, your `ls` command should only print the names of the files in the current directory that have the extension specified by the second argument. Your program should do its normal behaviour if no flag is provided.

Calling `node ls.js -ex js` from the lesson-1 folder of this repo should print:

`cat.js   ls.js`

### Exercise 1d - Making your script executable

So that was fun! But wouldn't it be nice if rather than having to type

`node script.js arguments`

and adjusting the script's file path all the time relative to our current location, we could just run `script` in our terminal anywhere in our directory tree and know it will work just like existing shell commands?

You can do that in node and it only takes a few simple steps!

1: In your cat.js file, add this to the top line of the file:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

2: Run `npm init` in the root folder of this repo and create a `package.json`.

3: Adjust your `package.json` as follows:

* Remove the main entry: this is only used for modules that will be used through the module system.
* Add `preferGlobal` and set it to `true`, which means if someone installs this module through npm and doesn’t use the `--global` option, they will be warned that the module is designed to be installed globally.
* Add the bin object, which maps commands to files. This means when this module is installed, npm will set up the named executables to execute their assigned javascript files. Don't name your commands after existing commands like cat or ls; they need to be unique.

Your `package.json` should now look like this:

```javascript
{
  "name": "node-shell-workshop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "learn how to shell script with node",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "your lovely selves",
  "license": "ISC",
  "preferGlobal": true,
  "bin": {
    "your-name-here-cat": "lesson-1/cat.js",
    "your-name-here-ls": "lesson-1/ls.js"
  }
}
```

4: Now in the same repo you can run `npm link` to install the script on your system. This creates a symlink to your project so that you can run the project whilst working on it, with no need to keep reinstalling it over and over again.

5: Now, move back into lesson-1 and try out...

```
your-name-here-cat file
```

_Does your command work regardless of where you are in the filesystem? If not, how could you fix that?_
